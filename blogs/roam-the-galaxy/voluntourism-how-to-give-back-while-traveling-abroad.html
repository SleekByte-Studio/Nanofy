	As travelers, we're incredibly fortunate to have the means and opportunity to
	explore different corners of the world. With this privilege comes a
	responsibility to protect these amazing destinations, support their local
	communities, and find meaningful ways to give back. While typical vacations
	allow you to experience the sights and culture of a place, incorporating
	volunteer work during your travels, also known as "voluntourism," lets you
	forge deeper connections, leave a positive impact, and bring home enriching
	experiences that money can't buy.
</p>
<p>
	Through my own journeys around the globe, voluntourism has enriched my life in
	more ways than I can count. It has allowed me to move beyond the tourist
	bubble, become part of the fabric of communities I've visited, and work
	alongside inspiring people from all walks of life. More than just an ethical
	way to see the world, voluntourism introduces you to issues you might have
	been blind to otherwise while giving you a chance to directly address them.
	This hands-on approach brings about greater cross-cultural understanding,
	self-growth, and the power to spark meaningful change.
</p>
<p>
	If you've been looking for ways to make your travels more purposeful, here are
	my top tips and insights for getting involved with voluntourism as you explore
	wonderful destinations around the world.
</p>
<p>
	Do Your Research Not all volunteer opportunities are created equal. Seek out
	organizations, communities, and projects that have an established, respected
	track record for ethical, sustainable and impactful work. Avoid "volunteer"
	programs that feel more like exploitation or commodification, especially of
	children. Instead, find initiatives that allow you to work alongside local
	leaders and communities in a spirit of solidarity, not cultural voyeurism.
</p>
<p>
	Online platforms like GoAbroad and Volunteer Forever are great resources for
	vetting programs, reading alumni reviews, and understanding the mission and
	methodologies behind each opportunity. You can filter volunteer work across
	causes like environmental conservation, teaching, women's empowerment,
	construction and more. I've had the most enriching experiences sticking to
	highly-vetted organizations recommended by trusted travel bloggers or
	non-profit authorities.
</p>
<p>
	Put In The Effort Quality voluntourism experiences aren't a quick,
	superficial, check-box activity. They require you to roll up your sleeves and
	immerse yourself in the work, no matter how exhausting or uncomfortable it may
	get at times. I've sweated endlessly in the blazing jungle heat clearing miles
	of plastic waste from beaches across Southeast Asia. I've worked grueling
	hours on organic farm co-ops in New Zealand and Hawaii, constantly battling
	the relentless sun, dirt and fatigue. On preservation pursuits helping replant
	forests in South America, I've returned to my accommodations every evening
	completely caked in mud from head to toe.
</p>
<p>
	While it can certainly be challenging, pushing past my limits and not shying
	away from the labor has allowed me to gain a greater connection to the people
	and places where I've worked. I've bonded with local communities over our
	shared struggles in the field and accomplishments at the end of long,
	rewarding days. Nothing brings people together like working side-by-side
	towards a common mission. My "vacations" have provided incredible strength,
	perspective and gratitude.
</p>
<p>
	Stay Humble As visitors stepping into new communities, it's crucial that we
	check any sense of ego, saviorism or privilege mentality at the door. One of
	voluntourism's greatest lessons is that we are there to help, not take over or
	push Western ways onto other cultures and customs. Everything we're doing has
	been led and informed by generations of traditional ecological knowledge,
	ancestral wisdom and established community priorities.
</p>
<p>
	We must be culturally respectful at all times, open to learning new approaches
	even if they push us outside our comfort zones. We're visitors in someone
	else's home, so humility is essential. Show up eager to learn, listen and
	serve however communities need - without judgment or assumption about the
	"right" way. On so many occasions, I've been in awe of the insight and
	creativity of local leaders overcoming challenges using their own ancestral
	knowledge and sustainable practices. We have so much to learn from people
	solving problems through their cultural ingenuity and human resilience.
</p>
<p>
	Manage Expectations Unlike transactional forms of travel, voluntourism
	requires an abundant mindset of patience and managing expectations properly.
	We're guests invited into complex scenarios and any community's needs evolve
	rapidly based on changing environments or contexts. We have to let go of our
	own assumptions, time constraints or agendas in order to meaningfully adapt to
	the work at hand and what people need in that moment.
</p>
<p>
	On a reforestation and education program in Costa Rica, I spent several
	intense weeks in a tiny community where deadly mudslides and flooding upended
	all plans and forced us to pivot to emergency response. It was devastating but
	also a profound lesson in showing up however I could to help in survival mode.
	In Guatemala, our initial education curriculums required complete overhaul
	based on fresh input from village elders to better align with cultural
	priorities. Those pivots ultimately led to more impactful outcomes, but forced
	us to constantly reset our own expectations along the way.
</p>
<p>
	There have been so many humbling reminders that the work being done is not
	about us. Remaining flexible, patient and humble enough to follow the true
	needs of communities is everything.
</p>
<p>
	Embrace Discomfort If you really want to push your personal growth and gain
	perspective-shifting realizations, you have to embrace some level of
	discomfort through voluntourism. On a construction project helping build
	smokeless chulah stoves for a remote village in India, I experienced
	first-hand just how physically draining and monotonous traditional labor can
	be. I didn't have the luxury of indoor plumbing, reliable electricity or my
	typical modern comforts. It was challenging and confronted me with my own
	privilege, but also underscored why sustainable infrastructure is so crucial
	for improving quality of life in these communities.
</p>
<p>
	Voluntourism opportunities have also challenged me mentally and emotionally,
	beyond just the physical difficulties. In South Africa, I met young orphans
	and heard devastating first-hand stories from those directly impacted by
	HIV/AIDS, poverty and systemic injustice. Teaching girls in rural Kenya opened
	my eyes to the unimaginable barriers, sexism and lack of opportunity women
	face in pursuing their education and independence. These profound encounters
	have shattered aspects of my worldview, while also providing the greatest
	personal growth and appreciation for the basic dignities I easily take for
	granted at home.
</p>
<p>
	Don't Quit After The Trip Finally, the most meaningful voluntourism
	experiences are ones that become integrated into your lifestyle and pursuits
	beyond just a single trip or project. I've developed lasting bonds with people
	and organizations around the world that I remain involved with supporting long
	after leaving - through fundraisers, skill-sharing, donations, advocacy
	campaigns and more.
</p>
<p>
	The entire experience of getting to know a local culture, its challenges and
	priorities, has motivated me to keep showing up however I can from afar. I'm
	now an active supporter of micro-finance programs in Southeast Asia, a donor
	to NGOs combating environmental racism and pollution in Africa, and a remote
	mentor for young girls in Latin America aspiring to get into STEM fields. The
	more you invest in relationships and understanding of an issue, the more
	equipped you are to continue contributing in impactful ways.
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the day, giving back through voluntourism has made me a more
	compassionate, open-minded and engaged global citizen. It has provided some of
	my richest travel memories filled with heart-changing encounters and
	eye-opening awakenings. More than just ensuring my travels are sustainable,
	getting hands-on with communities has deepened my connection to this
	awe-inspiring planet we all share.
</p>
<p>
	Money comes and goes but the experiences you gain by contributing your time
	and effort create ripples that extend far beyond a single trip. If you have
	the chance, I urge you to find a voluntourism opportunity that resonates with
	you and take that chance to be the change you wish to see in the world. It
	might just transform you as profoundly as the projects you take part in.
