	When it comes to family travel, finding destinations and activities that
	genuinely cater to all ages can feel like an impossible feat. As any parent
	knows, entertaining and engaging little ones requires creativity, patience and
	energy in spades. But that doesn't mean sacrificing an enriching, memorable
	experience for the adults too. From kid-approved museums and immersive
	cultural attractions to outdoor adventures and foodie-friendly hotspots,
	discovering the perfect family vacation sweet spot is all about syncing shared
	moments of wonder.
</p>
<p>
	Over the years traveling as a parent with two young kids in tow, I've become
	an expert at seeking out family-friendly destinations guaranteed to light up
	the faces of bleary-eyed parents and squirmy little ones alike. We've
	traversed bustling cities, tropical islands, national parks and charming small
	towns, putting in the footwork (like a million miles!) to separate the truly
	all-ages vacation gems from the over-hyped letdowns. Whether you prefer to
	stay stateside or have your sights set internationally, these are some of my
	favorite places around the world filled with attractions, activities and
	experiences tailored to delighting all generations.
</p>
<p>
	Washington D.C. Our nation's capital provides one of the most engaging,
	stimulating playgrounds for kids to experience American history and civic
	pride up close. Sure, world-class destinations like the Smithsonian National
	Air and Space Museum and National Museum of Natural History reign supreme with
	T-Rex fossils, planetarium shows and lunar modules galore. But D.C. also
	offers interactive living lessons around every corner from the stirring
	memorials and monuments along the National Mall to the edifying U.S. Capitol
	building tour and Bureau of Engraving and Printing where you can watch money
	being printed. Even just wandering around historical Georgetown's cobblestone
	streets, fudge shops and bookstores feels like being transported to a
	different era. No family trip is complete without at least catching a glimpse
	of The White House and learning about presidential history along the way.
</p>
<p>
	San Diego, California<br />
	Featuring a perfectly temperate climate and refreshing Pacific breezes, San
	Diego serves up sunny beachside bliss and incredible entertainment for
	families. The city's crown jewel is Balboa Park with its 1,200 acres
	encompassing fun-filled attractions like the San Diego Zoo (home to giant
	pandas!), educational science and natural history museums, playgrounds,
	performing arts spaces, gardens and more. You can easily spend days exploring
	all there is to see and do around Balboa's Spanish architecture before heading
	out for classic SoCal beach time and boardwalk ambiance in La Jolla, Coronado
	or along the city's pristine shorelines. The Midway aircraft carrier museum
	and Birch Aquarium provide fascinating nautical-themed entertainment while
	Belmont Park's vintage rides and coasters deliver nostalgic beachfront
	thrills.
</p>
<p>
	Riviera Maya, Mexico Seeking a tropical getaway where lazy beach days blend
	seamlessly with immersive cultural traditions and outdoor adventures? Then
	Mexico's Riviera Maya delivers the whole package for magical family memories.
	From snorkeling about Mayan reef ruins and cenotes (natural sinkholes) to
	zipline tours over lush jungles or floating along lazy rivers shadowed by
	ancient ruins like Chichen Itza, there's a bounty of activities to engage
	every thrill level. The Riviera's all-inclusive resorts offer incredible
	family-friendly amenities like sprawling pool complexes, children's clubs,
	water sports and splash zones built to delight guests of all ages. Plus,
	nearby Playa del Carmen is a vibrant walkable hub with diverse restaurants
	celebrating authentic Mexican cuisine and bustling evening entertainment
	districts. Give kids a taste of traditional music, dance and handicraft
	demonstrations for a culturally-enriching respite between beach days.
</p>
<p>
	Orlando, Florida No list of family vacation hotspots would be complete without
	giving kudos to Orlando, the undisputed Theme Park Capital of the World. This
	is where imaginations of all ages run wild across the wonderlands of Disney's
	Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, SeaWorld and
	Legoland Florida. Whether your kids dream of swooping on a broomstick with
	Harry Potter, stopping for photos with their favorite Disney characters or
	getting spritzed by the whale's blowhole at SeaWorld, every theme park offers
	immersive realms of sheer fantasy brought to vivid life. Even better, Orlando
	has superb deals on multi-day packages for budget-minded families to score
	more theme park magic for less.
</p>
<p>
	London, England<br />
	Across the pond, London ranks as one of Europe's most enthralling cities for
	families seeking cultural thrills steeped in history and modernity.
	Double-decker bus tours allow you to checkpoint iconic royal landmarks like
	Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Hyde Park, Westminster Abbey and the riotous Lego
	Store while keeping kids engaged. The Natural History Museum's dinosaur
	exhibits provide jaw-dropping dino encounters while interactive highlights at
	the British Museum and National Gallery make art and ancient antiquities come
	alive. You'll also find incredible theater performances from classics like The
	Lion King to family-centric musicals adapted for young audiences. And of
	course, London is a playground for fans of Harry Potter with walking tours of
	filming locations, re-created movie sets, and the beloved Platform 9 ¾ cart at
	King's Cross station.
</p>
<p>
	Costa Rica Pint-sized explorers will revel in being immersed within Costa
	Rica's natural wonderlands filled with misty rainforest canopies concealing
	sloths, monkeys and toucans, volcanic reserves delivering Mother Earth's
	dramatic bio-thrills, and pristine Pacific beaches ideal for spotting whales,
	sea turtles and colorful marine life while snorkeling or sailing. With its
	emphasis on environmental sustainability, a family adventure to Costa Rica
	opens eyes to the beauty and importance of protecting exotic ecosystems. Many
	resorts and tours tailor experiences just for kids, like watching baby turtles
	hatch, zip-lining through the cloud forest, rappelling down waterfalls or
	joining guided night hikes for encounters with critters. And when the day is
	done, serene eco-lodges deliver luxurious modern amenities surrounded by
	paradise.
</p>
<p>
	No matter their age or travel style, every family member will find incredible
	amusements to cherish during trips to places like these. From building
	sandcastles together on sunny beaches and reclining poolside for relaxation to
	embarking on silly character meet-and-greets or spine-tingling thrill rides,
	these destinations sprinkle shared magic and wonder into the recipe for
	unforgettable vacations.
</p>
<p>
	Here are a few more tips I've found helpful for making family travel a
	bonding, joy-filled experience:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Build anticipation by having kids do destination research to plan potential
		itineraries and get them hyped about attractions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Schedule down-time into each day for resting, lounging by the pool, etc.
		Travel can be overstimulating with too much constant hustle and bustle.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pencil in one or two surprise activities/events that kids don't know about.
		Keeping some mystery adds an extra element of excitement.
	</li>
	<li>
		When traveling with mixed-age kids, divide and conquer so one kid isn't
		always compromising plans for their sibling's sake. Take turns splitting up
		for individual interests.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pack ample snacks, water, portable battery packs for devices and a first-aid
		kit everywhere you go to avoid hangry meltdowns!
	</li>
	<li>
		Solicit feedback each night about their favorite parts or what to tweak for
		tomorrow so they feel part of the planning process.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	At the end of the day, making lasting family memories is what travel is all
	about. The opportunity to widen our children's perspective beyond their
	backyards, to teach them about different cultures and environments, to see
	their eyes sparkle in awe - those are the heartwarming moments I cherish as a
	parent. Family vacations may feel daunting to plan, but the rewards gained
	from shared quality time and new discoveries that create cozy reminiscences
	for decades to come - well, you can't put a price on that.

                                       Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
