	stay helps fund things like solar panels, water conservation systems, and
	green space preservation. Every step they take to reduce environmental impact
	makes a difference.
</p>

<h3>Experience Natural Beauty</h3>

	beaches. Waking up to those views is a perfect way to reconnect with nature.
</p>

<h3>Learn Valuable Lessons</h3>

	Eco-lodges aim to educate guests about environmental responsibility and often
	offer programs on topics like reducing waste or supporting local communities.
	You can learn practical tips for more sustainable living that you can apply at
	home. Interacting with staff and like-minded guests also exposes you to new
	perspectives on how we can all work together to protect our planet.
</p>

<h3>Support Local Communities</h3>

<p>
	Sustainable hotels frequently employ staff from nearby communities and use
	local suppliers for food, crafts and other goods. By staying there, you
	directly contribute to the local economy. Some eco-lodges also donate a
	portion of profits to community development programs or allow guests to
	sponsor local students. It's a meaningful way to give back during your
	travels.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, choosing an eco-friendly hotel or lodge for your next vacation can be
	highly rewarding. You'll come home refreshed, enlightened and inspired to make

</p>

<h2>Hit the Slopes! Top Skiing and Snowboarding Destinations</h2>

<h3>Pipeline, North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii</h3>

<p>
	No list of legendary surf spots is complete without Pipeline. The massive
	barrels here are the stuff of surfing dreams. In the winter, swells can reach
	up to 60 feet, though 10 to 15 feet is more common. Either way, this is not a
	wave for beginners. If you've got the skills, the rewards are worth it - just
	watch out for the razor-sharp reef below.
</p>

<h3>Supertubes, Jeffrey's Bay, South Africa</h3>

<p>
	If you prefer riding longer, more consistent barrels, head to Jeffrey's Bay in
	South Africa. The waves here seem to go on forever, some lasting up to a
	quarter mile. The break is fast, powerful, and not too crowded, especially if
	you come in the off-season. For the ultimate thrill, hit the wave during a
	competition and watch the pros do their thing.
</p>

<h3>Cloud Nine, Siargao Island, Philippines</h3>

<p>
	For a taste of paradise, check out Cloud Nine in the Philippines. This
	secluded reef break offers huge, hollow barrels and stunning turquoise water.
	After your session, relax in a beachfront bungalow or sample fresh seafood at
	a local cafe. The vibe here is laid-back, the crowds are minimal, and the surf
	is unreal. What more could you want?
</p>

<h3>Rincon, Santa Barbara, California</h3>

<p>
	Just off the coast of Santa Barbara sits one of California's most iconic
	waves. Rincon is a fast, powerful reef break that churns out thick, barreling
	rights - considered by some to be the longest rideable waves in the state. The
	water is cold, the rocks are sharp, and the locals can be territorial, but
	when the conditions are right, Rincon is a surfing nirvana. Timing is
	everything, so watch the forecasts and jump on a swell when one comes through.
</p>

<h2>Feel the Rush! White Water Rafting Hot Spots</h2>

<h3>The Swiss Alps, Switzerland</h3>

<p>
	If you want to experience the stunning snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps,
	head to resorts like Zermatt, St. Moritz or Davos. Glide down over 200 miles
	of slopes while taking in the breathtaking views. Most resorts offer terrain
	for all skill levels, as well as plenty of off-piste skiing for
	thrill-seekers. Après-ski activities like shopping, dining and nightlife
	abound in the charming alpine villages.
</p>

<h3>Whistler Blackcomb, British Columbia, Canada</h3>

<p>
	Consistently ranked as one of the top ski resorts in North America, Whistler
	Blackcomb offers over 8,000 acres of slopes across 16 alpine bowls and over
	200 marked runs. The resort gets an average of 459 inches of snowfall each
	year, so conditions are usually prime for skiing and snowboarding. Two
	gondolas and 37 lifts help you access terrain for all abilities. When you're
	done on the slopes, explore the pedestrian village with shops, restaurants,
	bars and nightclubs.
</p>

<p>
	New Zealand's stunning natural scenery provides the perfect backdrop for an
	exciting snow adventure. The resort town of Queenstown on the South Island is
	a top ski destination, offering slopes for all skill levels. It's home to four
	ski fields, including The Remarkables and Coronet Peak, which offer over 200
	ski runs combined. Queenstown is also a popular base for heli-skiing, where
	helicopters drop you on pristine snowfields for a true thrill ride. After a
	day of adventure, enjoy the vibrant nightlife, fine dining and stunning lake
	and mountain views.
</p>

<h2>Reach New Heights! Rock Climbing and Mountaineering Adventures</h2>

<h3>The Zambezi River, Zimbabwe/Zambia</h3>

<p>
	For thrill seekers, the Zambezi River offers some of the most intense rafting
	in the world. As one of the wildest rivers in Africa, the Zambezi features

	for the biggest rapids.
