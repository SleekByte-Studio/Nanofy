                        <p>
	As someone who loves the freedom and spontaneity of solo travel, I've learned
	that there's no better way to embrace new experiences than by exploring the
	world on your own. Don't get me wrong - I cherish the memories made on trips
	with friends, family and partners. There's nothing quite like sharing amazing
	moments and making inside jokes with your closest companions. But solo travel
	holds a totally different kind of magic. It allows you to move at your own
	pace, follow your curiosities down serendipitous paths, and discover so much
	about yourself and the world around you.
</p>
<p>
	My first solo trip as a bright-eyed 22-year-old felt both thrilling and
	daunting. I spent two weeks backpacking around Ireland, winging it from
	coastal town to town with just a guidebook, map and my ambition to embrace
	every opportunity. Those solo adventures kickstarted my deep love for
	independent travel and all the soul-enriching growth it brings. Over a decade
	later, I've solo traveled everywhere from Portugal to Cambodia and so many
	places in between. With each new solo journey, I become more confident in my
	ability to navigate the world alone and open myself up to life's infinite
	possibilities.
</p>
<p>
	If you've been toying with the idea of taking a solo trip but have
	hesitations, I'm here to share my top tips and personal stories that will
	(hopefully!) empower you to take the leap. Going solo allows you to step out
	of your comfort zone, connect deeper with locals, and gain an unmatched sense
	of independence. You'll walk away with lifelong travel memories and a broader
	perspective on yourself and the world around you.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #1: Choose your solo travel destination wisely For your first solo
	adventure, I recommend picking a destination that excites you but also has
	good tourism infrastructure, reasonably safe cities, and a fairly easy
	language barrier if you don't already know the local tongue. English-friendly
	places like England, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand are great starter
	options with vibrant hostels, friendly locals and tons of group tour offerings
	if you want to meet fellow travelers. I felt incredibly safe and independent
	during my solo walks around Dublin, Galway and the villages of southern
	Ireland.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #2: Start small with shorter trips There's no need to plan a multi-month
	epic around-the-world adventure for your first solo rodeo. Begin by testing
	the solo travel waters with a shorter trip, maybe a week or two. This allows
	you to gain confidence traveling independently without being too ambitious or
	overwhelming right out of the gate. For my first solo trip at 22, two weeks on
	my own in Ireland felt manageable and not too daunting.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #3: Stay in social hostels to meet fellow travelers Hostels are an amazing
	way to meet other solo travelers while keeping costs down. But avoid the super
	basic, quiet hostels where you might feel isolated. Instead, I suggest looking
	for livelyhostels that organize group activities and pub crawls where you can
	easily meet fellow adventurers. In addition to socializing in common areas
	like bars and game rooms, sign up for walking tours, cooking classes or day
	trips. You'll instantly connect with people who are in the same shoes as you -
	solo and loving it!
</p>
<p>
	A few years ago, I spent a week solo in an amazing hostel in Mexico City. On
	my first night, I bonded with three other American girls over tequila shots at
	the bar. We ended up being explorers-in-crime that entire week, splitting
	costs on a hot air balloon ride, Unesco site tours and so many delicious tacos
	and mezcal tastings. To this day they're some of my closest amigas thanks to
	the shared experience of taking the plunge to travel alone.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #4: Follow your intuition and listen to your gut One of solo travel's
	greatest gifts is that it will rapidly sharpen your instincts and self-trust.
	While it's wise to be cautious and aware of your surroundings, you'll develop
	a powerful sense of gut instinct telling you when a situation feels right or
	not. When I follow my gut feeling about people or circumstances, I've always
	been steered in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
	On a solo trip to Vietnam, my gut told me not to get in a certain taxi late at
	night, despite cheaper prices. I ended up paying a bit more to Grab back to my
	hostel but avoided a sketchier situation. Another time in Paris, my instincts
	told me a certain neighborhood didn't feel right at night, so I altered my
	route to get back before dark. Trust yourself and never ignore signals telling
	you a situation doesn't feel safe.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #5: Embrace spontaneity Flying solo means you can be as deliciously
	spontaneous as your heart desires! No need to get group consensus before
	changing plans on a whim. If you hear about an amazing hike, pop-up restaurant
	experience or late night festival from fellow travelers, you can embrace the
	opportunity in that moment. Some of my absolute favorite travel memories stem
	from taking random detours.
</p>
<p>
	In Croatia, I met a man at a cafe who invited me to join his group of friends
	for an impromptu booze cruise that afternoon - how could I say no?! We spent a
	sublime summer day coasting around islands, swimming off the back of the boat
	and laughing over bottles of homemade wine. In Morocco, a carpet seller led me
	through labyrinth alleys to experience a sacred music ritual - something I
	could've easily missed without the freedom to follow my nose for adventure.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #6: Step out of your comfort zone The best way to turbocharge your
	personal growth? Push past your typical comfort zones! Solo travel constantly
	challenges you to try new things, meet different people and reconsider your
	perspectives. You're the only one holding yourself back from fulfilling that
	travel bucket list.
</p>
<p>
	From canyoning in Switzerland to taking a solo bylam trek through Bhutan to
	spending days riding camels through the Sahara, I've said yes to so many
	heart-pumping adventures I might have otherwise shied away from in the comfort
	of my regular routine. Book that extreme sport outing, sign up for that
	cooking class, or join that midnight tour of a lamp-lit local fish market.
	Learn to view the world through a different lens and you may discover a braver
	version of yourself!
</p>
<p>
	Tip #7: Taper caution and confidence While solo travel is incredibly safe,
	freeing and empowering, it's wise to take some personal safety precautions.
	Don't allow fear to rule you but do listen closely to trusted local advice.
	Talk to staff at your accommodation, other solo travelers you meet, and tours
	guides to understand areas to avoid and cultural norms to respect. And always
	have a backup plan for transportation, copies of ID, and a way to get cash in
	case of emergencies.
</p>
<p>
	Tip #8: Soak in the solitude Finally, my most cherished solo travel moments
	involve basking in blissful solitude and feeling intimately connected with
	incredible destinations. From journaling in cozy London pubs and Belgrade
	cafes to watching sunrises alone on rooftops in Marrakech and Luang Prabang,
	these quiet introspective moments are what solo travel is all about. Slow
	down, soak it all in, and enjoy being present with yourself amidst the
	beautiful surroundings.
</p>
<p>
	Growing up, I was quite shy and fearful of being alone or uncomfortable
	situations. Yet solo travel has completely obliterated those anxieties and
	insecurities. I've learned to embrace going with the flow and rolling with
	whatever curveballs come my way. Through gaining confidence in myself and my
	decision-making abilities, I now welcome uncertainty as a path to greater
	freedom, self-awareness and eye-opening discoveries.
</p>
<p>
	If you're able, I can't recommend solo travel enough to awaken that same sense
	of independence, possibility and awe for our incredible world. So book that
	first one-way ticket, get a little summer fling with freedom, and discover
	where your own soulful solo journey can take you!
